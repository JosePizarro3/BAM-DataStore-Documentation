# Welcome to the BAM Data Store documentation page.

The BAM **Data Store** is a central system for digital Research Data Management at the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). It is a modified instance of [openBIS](https://openbis.ch/), so this documentation page does not intend to replace the openBIS documentation, but rather serve as an additional source of information for BAM employees who use the Data Store

<!-- This documentation page is divided according to the [diataxis method](https://www.diataxis.fr/). -->
